If the Jupyter Notebook **does not load** or is **displayed with formatting errors**, you can view the notebook using either of the two methods below:-

1. Access the notebook via this Google Colaboratory shareable link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PKMncG6i41GNMacVSC3DLYdUqzdhXTWm

2. Access the current Github repository using Binder and view the notebook there - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IshaanVasant/Data_Science_Capstone/master 
Note: The folium maps will not render in Binder and have therefore been uploaded to the current Github repository.
